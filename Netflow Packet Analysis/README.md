# Netflow Packet Analysis


A little experience on analyzing the publicly available network measurement data to understand various properties of Internet. Used the pandas python library for most of the analysis, along with numpy, and matplotlib to plot the graphs.

## Executing the python script:

* Install needed packages using pip:
 
 *pip3 install pandas*
 
 *pip install numpy == 1.19.3*  (version 1.19.4 doesn't work, patch pending)

 *pip install matplotlib*
 
 * Run script: 
 
 *python3 Ramirez_DianaAssing5.py*
 
 (all tasks are done in the same script, feel free to comment task operations)
